Need to study:
To implement telemetry in JavaScript effectively, there are several important concepts and techniques you should be familiar with. These concepts will help you collect, process, and analyze data efficiently. Here are some key concepts:

1. **Event Handling:** JavaScript is event-driven, so understanding how to handle events is crucial. You'll use event listeners to track user interactions, page loads, and other relevant events.

2. **Asynchronous Programming:** Many telemetry tasks involve asynchronous operations, such as making HTTP requests, reading from files, or working with databases. You'll need to be comfortable with callbacks, Promises, and async/await to manage asynchronous code effectively.

3. **Data Collection:** Implementing telemetry starts with collecting data. This could include user interactions, performance metrics, error logs, or any other relevant information. You'll need to know how to gather and structure this data.

4. **HTTP Requests:** Most telemetry systems involve sending data to a server for storage and analysis. Understanding how to make HTTP requests using methods like `fetch` or libraries like Axios is essential for transmitting telemetry data.

5. **Data Serialization:** Data collected in JavaScript often needs to be serialized into a format like JSON before transmission to a server. You should know how to convert JavaScript objects to JSON and vice versa.

6. **Error Handling:** Implementing telemetry includes tracking and reporting errors. Familiarize yourself with JavaScript's error handling mechanisms, including try/catch blocks and global error event listeners.

7. **LocalStorage and Cookies:** You might need to store data locally on the user's device for telemetry purposes. Understanding how to work with browser storage options like LocalStorage and Cookies is helpful.

8. **Web APIs:** JavaScript provides access to various browser APIs that are useful for telemetry, such as the `Performance API` for measuring page performance or the `Navigator` object for extracting user agent information.

9. **Security:** Ensure that you follow security best practices when implementing telemetry. This includes protecting sensitive data, validating inputs, and securing data transmission (e.g., using HTTPS).

10. **Data Analytics:** Once you've collected telemetry data, you'll likely want to analyze it to gain insights. Familiarity with data analysis libraries and techniques, such as using libraries like D3.js or charting libraries for visualization, can be beneficial.

11. **Data Privacy:** Be aware of data privacy regulations and principles (e.g., GDPR) when collecting and handling user data. Implement appropriate consent mechanisms and data anonymization techniques.

12. **Monitoring and Alerting:** Setting up monitoring and alerting systems is essential for real-time telemetry. You may use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or custom alerting scripts to stay informed about critical events.

13. **Testing and Quality Assurance:** Rigorous testing is crucial to ensure the accuracy and reliability of your telemetry system. Familiarize yourself with testing frameworks like Jest for unit testing and tools for end-to-end testing.

14. **Documentation and Logging:** Maintain clear and comprehensive documentation for your telemetry implementation. Implement logging mechanisms to track the behavior of your telemetry code for debugging and troubleshooting.

15. **Optimization:** Depending on the scale of your telemetry system, performance optimization may be necessary. Knowledge of JavaScript optimization techniques and profiling tools can help identify and address bottlenecks.

16. **Concurrency and Parallelism:** For high-performance telemetry systems, you may need to work with concurrency and parallelism concepts in JavaScript, such as Web Workers or async tasks.
